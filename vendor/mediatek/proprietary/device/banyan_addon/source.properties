The SDK consists of two packages - "MediaTek SDK API" and "MediaTek SDK Toolset". The SDK API package provides API libraries, documents and Android add-on components. The toolset package offers MediaTek customized tools that can help debugging.\n\n\nMediaTek SDK Libraries\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThere are two API libraries in the SDK package, "mediatek-framework.jar" and "mediatek-compatibility.jar. They are located under libs/ folder.\n\n\nmediatek-framework.jar\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt is the MediaTek SDK API library that contains APIs of MediaTek platform specific features. Applications can enhance their capabilities for MediaTek hardware by leveraging from the APIs. For detailed usage, refer to the documentation included in the SDK package.\n\nIt is to be noted that the library binary contains only API signatures. Do not compile them directly into the application. Executing the code inside will cause runtime exceptions.\n\n\nmediatek-compatibility.jar\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt is an utility library that contains methods for checking if a feature is supported by the device that the application is currently running on. When calling those methods on non-MediaTek platforms, they will simply return negative values (i.e. not supported).\n\nTo use it, copy the JAR file to your project's libs/ folder. In Eclipse, the library classes should automatically be accessible.\n\n
